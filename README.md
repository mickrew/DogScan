# DogScan
The goal of this project is to create a search engine able to recognize the breed of a dog starting from an image uploaded by the user. The engine shows also the most similar pictures to the selected one. We implemented from scratch our version of IVFADC-Index to enable fast similarity search on deep features. For what concerns the Deep Neural Network, we exploited different versions of ResNet, first performing feature extraction and then applying fine tuning of some layers. Finally, a web user interface has been built to allow the search engine to be used in a web browser.
